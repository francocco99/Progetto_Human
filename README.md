# Spoiler Detection Project
This is a project for the Human Language Technology 2023/2024 course. This project focuses on detecting spoiler reviews on IMDb. The dataset is taken from Kaggle and consists of two files:

* Movie dataset: Contains information about the movies reviewed by the users, such as the movie plot synopsis.
* Review dataset: Contains the text of the reviews and other metadata.
## Implementation
The idea is to use different language models to classify the reviews. We start from a **baseline** using simple models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes, and gradually move to more complex models like LLama3. A more detailed description of the work is in the [**PDF**](https://github.com/francocco99/Spoiler_Detecion_Project/blob/main/Group10_Report.pdf)
This project is being made in group:
* [Francesco Botrugno](https://github.com/FranBot97)
* [Agnese Camici](https://github.com/agnesecam)
